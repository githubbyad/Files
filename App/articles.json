We must champion real, long-term investment in education, not just quick wins for political press releases.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe great Lime bike swap\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EWhile students have been focused on the future, the Labour administration has been busy looking at the bottom line. You may have seen the recent City AM article highlighting Hounslow Council’s decision to quietly drop Lime Bikes from its e-bike operations in favour of Forest, a move that raises serious questions.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EAccording to the report, Forest scored poorly on key operational criteria, including parking management and safety features, yet won the contract by offering the council significantly more revenue, around five times higher than expected. In short, it appears to have been a ‘cash-first’ decision.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003ELet’s be clear: a council should not be running a transport strategy like a hedge fund. Residents deserve sustainable, well-managed services, not companies cutting corners to meet inflated payment promises. Industry experts have warned that such deals are often unsustainable, leading to renegotiation or service collapse down the line. If this contract was awarded for financial gain over public interest, it will come back to bite us.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EIn Chiswick, Lime Bikes were heavily used. The decision to swap providers has been politically spun as ‘listening to residents’ but in practice, it’s just replacing one dockless scheme with another, without fixing the original problems. A genuine consultation would have focused on better infrastructure, no bikes on pavements or running red lights, clearer parking bays, no underage cyclists and scooterists, and overall improved accountability from the operator and council alike, not a shiny new logo.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EFinal thought\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EWhile Labour focus on PR and internal promotions, we in the Conservative Group will continue to focus on what matters: education, transparency, and proper governance. There is a better way of running this borough, and it starts with honest conversations, not self-congratulation.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EEnjoy the rest of your summer, and if you’re in Cranford, we’ll look forward to seeing you at the polling station ready for your vote at the ballot box.\u003C/body\u003E\u003C/html\u003E",

The activity is part of the Home Office’s Safer Summer Streets campaign, running until the end of September.\u003Cbr\u003E \u003Cbr\u003ESteven Barrs, 44, of Peabody Estate, stole items worth £624 from the Co-op store on St Ann’s Road between March and May 2025.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHe was sentenced to six months in prison in June 2025.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPaul Gerrard, Director of Campaigns, Public Affairs and Policy, at the Co-op said: “Co-op has been a relentless campaigner to tackle retail crime and our partnerships with police forces across the UK are central to how we protect our colleagues, the shops they run and the communities they serve.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E“We currently have 20 police partnerships nationwide, which continues to drive an increase in the number of offenders tackled, more sentences handed down and more rehabilitation orders than ever before. This illustrates how when retailers and police commit to working together and share intelligence, the prolific and persistent offenders who are behind the vast majority of retail crime can be tackled - and that's good for shops but, importantly, also for the communities that rely on them.”\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDeputy Assistant Commissioner Ben Russell, the Met’s lead for Safer Summer Streets, said: “Town centres across London continue to see an enhanced police presence this summer, building on reductions in theft, burglary, knife crime and robbery achieved so far this year, and more shoplifting cases solved.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E“Despite the Met facing significant demand elsewhere in the capital — including festivals, concerts, sporting events and large protests — we are relentlessly focusing our resources on tackling the crimes that matter most to Londoners. Every day, we are targeting the prolific offenders who make the lives of others a misery.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E“Through precise community crimefighting and intensified multi-agency action in 20 hotspots areas, offending is down and arrests are up.”\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECrime and Policing Minister, Dame Diana Johnson commented: “High streets and town centres are the very heart of our communities, but a decade of cuts to neighbourhood policing has left our town centres suffering from such little visible policing presence.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E'We are working to turn this around. As part of our Plan for Change, we are boosting the number of neighbourhood police officers and delivering a summer blitz on town centre crime - sending a clear message to those who bring misery to our streets that their crimes will not go unpunished.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E“These initial results from the Met are exactly what we want to see and demonstrate what we can achieve with a smart approach and more visible police presence, along with multi-agency action. I am grateful for their continued efforts to make streets safer for Londoners.”",

With temperatures rising in London over the summer months and the number of wildfires increasing, the mayor says he is ‘determined to do everything possible to ensure the capital is prepared for the ongoing impact of climate change, wildfires and extreme heat’.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThis summer alone, the London Fire Brigade (LFB) has already responded to 64 wildfires, compared to just 19 in the entire summer of 2020 — a staggering 237 per cent increase. On 19th July 2022, the London Fire Brigade experienced its busiest day since World War II due to wildfire and extreme heat related calls. Demand on LFB services has remained consistently high since then.\u003Cbr /\u003E \u003Cbr /\u003EHigher temperatures coupled with the below average-rainfall experienced so far this year mean that the risk of wildfires in London is currently considered as severe by the Natural Hazards Partnership.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe mayor is calling for better education for all Londoners, enhanced partnership work and sustainable funding for fire services to help keep everyone safe from wildfires.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EWith so many green spaces and parks in London bordering residential areas, the mayor continues to work with the London Fire Brigade so they are prepared to prevent and deal with wildfires in another summer of extreme heat.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThanks to record funding from City Hall, the London Fire Brigade has invested in enhanced training and new equipment. This includes:\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDrones which provide real-time aerial views to map fire spread and direct resources where they are needed most;\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESpecialised ‘Holey Hoses’ that create a curtain of water reaching up to two metres high when a fire is spreading across land, the hose will be deployed to protect life, property and wildlife;\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENew off-road 4X4 wildfire response vehicles capable of reaching fires quickly across difficult terrain, including grassland. These vehicles can extinguish fires on the move and be used to create firebreaks – using water to soak the ground to help stop fires from spreading further;\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESpecialist responders trained in wildfire dynamics and firefighting tactics.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003EThe mayor and the London Fire Brigade are also working closely with partners including the Natural Hazards Partnership, the Met Office and the UK Health Security Agency, using their expertise to highlight risks and quickly scale up resources in the event of a high demand incident – including flash flooding.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe LFB continues to work closely with London boroughs to help prevent fires. This includes working together to manage open spaces by keeping grass short and removing cuttings to reduce the risk of wildfires. This is especially important on land adjacent to homes and businesses.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003ELong periods of hot, dry weather mean that it only takes a spark to cause a wildfire and whilst wildfires can start naturally, the majority of fires are started deliberately or accidentally by members of the public. This happened in Dagenham in July and required around 125 firefighters to safely extinguish a fire in parkland. It was only thanks to the quick and efficient actions of crews, who used new equipment, skills and specially trained officers, as well as the proactive work of councils to create fire breaks, that prevented the fire from spreading to surrounding homes.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003ESince the start of June, nearly 80 fires in locations such as open grassland, scrubland, woodland, parks and other green spaces have been recorded as deliberate. And whilst temperatures are expected to fall slightly in the next week, London’s grass can be tinderbox dry following weeks of sunshine and little rain. That's why the mayor is urging Londoners to take care, be responsible and follow LFB prevention advice.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EHe said: “The climate crisis is having a devastating impact on our environment with temperatures rising in London, across the UK and around the world. Wildfires are raging across Europe engulfing green spaces, endangering homes, forcing evacuations and posing a genuine threat to life. This isn’t a faraway issue, it's on our doorstep. London continues to experience wildfires during the summer months, and I’m determined to do everything possible to ensure the capital is as prepared as possible for the impact of climate change, wildfires and extreme heat.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E“We’ve been working proactively with the London Fire Brigade and partners to ensure our city is ready to prevent and deal with wildfires. But everyone needs to do their bit. This means calling 999 if you see a wildfire, educating yourself on the risks and following key advice from the London Fire Brigade.'\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003ELondon Fire Commissioner Jonathan Smith said: “The risk of wildfires in London is increasing, driven by hotter, drier weather that makes it far easier for fires to start and spread rapidly.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E“Thanks to record investment from the mayor, we’ve strengthened our training and expanded our wildfire capabilities, introducing new equipment and trialling new response vehicles to keep Londoners safe. This includes specialist off-road 4x4 wildfire response vehicles to reach fires quickly in challenging terrain, drones providing real-time aerial mapping, and specialist hoses designed to protect people, property and green spaces.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E'As our climate changes, we must adapt and stay ahead of the risks. By working closely with communities, landowners and our partners, we can reduce the likelihood of wildfires and ensure that when they do occur, we are ready to respond effectively. The safety of Londoners will always be our highest priority, and we will continue to invest, develop and train to meet future challenges head on.”\u003C/body\u003E\u003C/html\u003E",

This means that it can handover information to different care services in an efficient and secure way, while also making it easier to use the technology across the country if tests are successful.\u003Cbr\u003E \u003Cbr\u003EThe Trust is using AI and data tools to automatically identify patients ready for discharge to free up beds as well as matching last-minute outpatient slots with patients who can attend at short notice. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPart of the government’s AI Exemplars programme, it is said that the tool ‘could deliver the support that NHS staff have been crying out for’ – helping doctors to draft discharge documents faster by extracting key details from medical records, such as diagnoses and test results, using a large language model. After a full review from a medical expert responsible for the patient, these documents are then used to discharge a patient from a ward and refer them to other care services that may be needed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOn 13th August, the Department of Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) along with Technology Secretary Peter Kyle visited the Trust to learn more about the different ways they are implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) to support patient care.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESpeaking on the visit, Kyle said: ‘‘This is exactly the kind of change we need: AI being used to give doctors, probation officers and other key workers more time to focus on delivering better outcomes and speeding up vital services.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E‘‘This government inherited a public sector decimated by years of under-investment and is crying out for reform.

That book sold out on the launch day, was reprinted and is now a collectors’ item. \u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EIn a statement discussing the upcoming publication, Abundance London said: ‘‘Chiswick has a long and distinguished fruity history, seeing the launch of apple and pear varieties of international importance that have spread around the world and changed the landscapes and eating habits of millions of people. The first national conferences on fruit varieties were held in Chiswick in the 19th century, and the most successful horticultural show in the world, the Chelsea Flower Show was held here for the first decades of its existence. Even today Chiswick’s oldest trees date back to the era of nursery and market gardens and orchards, and can be found in local private gardens and public spaces. Newly planted orchards in Chiswick House, Gunnersbury Park and Dukes Meadows continue the tradition. Yet bitter battles have also raged over the planting of additional fruit trees that might drop their fruit onto public paths. This book provides a fascinating and attractive insight into a unique aspect of our local area.’’\u003Cbr /\u003E \u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cimg align='center' class='pagephoto' src='https://chiswickherald.co.uk/18-8-2025-2-57-0-pm-5805442.jpg' /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EAbundance London has been running fruit picking sessions and Apple Day festivities since 2010.

However, that’s not to say that even with the summer holidays that we’ve been resting on our laurels.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003ENext week, residents of Cranford will go to the polls to decide who they want the third councillor to represent them to be…will it be more of the same, or something different?\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EI was out speaking with residents in Cranford a couple of weeks ago, and it really amazed me how many of them felt neglected by Hounslow Council. Despite having three Labour councillors, many felt like they had voices that were not listened to by this current administration, or were quite simply ignored. And to be honest, they were grateful to see a councillor of any political colour.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EWhat were their challenges? Pretty much the same as Chiswick; poor quality streets, trees (not enough or in the wrong location), decent street lighting and weeds.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EFor so long, I’ve been told that the challenges in the east and the west of the borough are different, but speaking with residents, it was fundamentally clear that we all want the same thing - somewhere to live where we can feel safe, be part of a community we can be proud of and certainly not worry about making it home at night without tripping over some unseen obstacle because it’s too dark to tell the tree roots from the weeds!\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EI’m currently writing this from Scotland, having travelled for the wedding of friends that I made while I was living in Aberdeen, and what has been a lovely recurring theme is that in order to have a village, you need to be a villager. It’s a lovely sentiment, but what does that mean in this day and age?\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EWell, for me it’s about community and being an active participant in my local area through politics, for some it’s about helping their neighbours, and for others, it’s about creating a safe space where anyone is welcome to be who they are provided that they don’t harm or insult others. On those rare occasions where you don’t like the other villagers, it’s vital to remember that we’re all different and we all have something we can contribute.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003ECommunity doesn’t come in a one-size fits all, however if I learned anything from this wedding, it is that once you’re all standing in a circle being shouted dance moves by a man with a guitar, swinging each other round and trying not to fall over while listening to a fiddle in a field, it doesn’t matter where you come from. Provided nobody ends up with an injury, you’ll be laughing and have created memories that will last a lot longer than the songs played that night.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EIt’s just up to each of us to decide what kind of villager we want to be - do we want to sit on the sidelines, watching the revellers and listening to the music, or do we want to be in the mix, dancing the steps, and even if the risk of injury may be high; will the joy of being involved and part of something bigger than ourselves create a better change beyond the dance?\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003ETo those who may be waiting for someone to ask them to dance, it may never happen; but if you stand up and enter it the rewards could be life-changing.\u003C/body\u003E\u003C/html\u003E",

In total, 507 new homes have been built on the council’s land at the estate since then.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHowever, work on the 413 further homes planned in the fourth and final phase of regeneration has been on hold since 2023, when lead contractor Real collapsed into insolvency.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBut now progress can begin again thanks to the deal between the council, housing association A2Dominion, and Green Man Lane LLP – the legal entity they created together to deliver the project.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe council says 127 of the new homes set to be built in the final phase will be let at ‘genuinely affordable’ rents to A2Dominion tenants, priced well within the means of people on low incomes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe council will get 75% of nominations to socially rented homes at the estate for the next 60 years when they become vacant. They will be filled by eligible families from the council’s housing register – its ‘waiting list’. There are now almost 7,500 local households on the register.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESecure council tenants at the estate have been offered the option of either moving into a new home at the rebuilt estate as A2Dominion tenants or moving elsewhere in the borough as a council tenant.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EA further 54 of the homes set to be built will be available at intermediate rent – an affordable housing scheme that allows eligible renters including key workers to pay approximately 20% less than the market rate, helping them save towards homeownership.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E52 homes will be available as shared ownership. The remainder will be sold on the open market, with sales used to offset the cost of building the homes to let.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe project has also seen the development of a new community centre, a community café, and a new building for St John’s Primary School. A new church hall is also planned as part of phase 4.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe partners are now working to appoint a new construction contractor.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EEaling Council Leader Peter Mason said: “Once this final phase is complete at Green Man Lane, almost 400 more local families will have a safe, secure place to call home. We are fulfilling our pledge to create strong and thriving communities filled with pride, identity, and purpose, where residents can build better lives. With some of London’s best parks and green spaces, outstanding schools, and unrivalled transport links, our borough is, and will continue to be, a great place to live.”\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECouncillor Shital Manro, Lead Member for Good Growth and New Homes, added: “Our borough is one of the least affordable places to live in the country. In recent years, an unprecedented number of local people have found themselves priced out of the housing market and have had no choice but to approach the council for help because they were at immediate risk of homelessness. We will continue doing everything we can to make sure our residents get the homes they need.”\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDoreen Wright, Commercial Director at A2Dominion, said: “We are pleased to take a significant step closer to completing this major regeneration project at the Green Man Lane estate in Ealing. Over the past two decades, A2Dominion and partners have played a key role in transforming this neighbourhood, delivering hundreds of modern homes, a new primary school and improved amenity spaces. This final phase will complement the diverse housing offering and provide more affordable homes for the people of Ealing.”",

Together, we're helping to protect and celebrate the borough’s rich artistic and cultural heritage, making H&F an even better place to live, work and enjoy.’’\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe council’s contribution will come from the Community Infrastructure Levy – a fund paid by property developers to support local facilities and infrastructure.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EJoanna Edmunds, Chair of St Peter’s Residents’ Association said: ‘‘The Greek Runner is the focal point of St Peter's Square, which lies at the heart of the St Peter’s Residents’ Association. The Square hosts many of our community events as well as being an everyday meeting place, and the Greek Runner is a constant reminder of our local heritage. Both the Greek Runner and the Square are grade II listed, as are many of the houses around. Many in the community feel a great responsibility to ensure the preservation of this history and feel privileged to live in the area.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E‘‘St Peter’s Residents’ Association is delighted to partner with LBHF to restore the statue and ensure its preservation for the next 100 years. We are looking forward to seeing the statue restored to its (near) original state and are grateful to the council for supporting this initiative, which has been widely welcomed locally.’’\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe statue was sculpted by Sir William Blake Richmond (1842-1921), a renowned British artist best known for his portraits and the dazzling mosaics inside St Paul's Cathedral. A leading figure in the Arts and Crafts Movement, Richmond lived and worked for many years in the parish of St Peter’s, Hammersmith.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EHis Greek Runner blends classical elegance with Victorian artistry – an enduring tribute to movement, grace and local pride. The statue was cast in 1879 at the famous Thames Ditton Foundry and gifted to the square in 1926 by Richmond's family. It’s not just a striking centrepiece – it's a Grade II-listed monument, officially recognised as part of the nation's heritage.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe Greek Runner is nestled in one of only two parks in H&F with listed status – the other being Bishops Park. Over the decades, it has stood as a silent witness to everything from wartime blackouts to joyful summer picnics and dog walks.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe council says this project is more than just a repair – it’s a celebration of heritage and a chance for the community to come together in support of public art. \u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThis project has been made possible thanks to the generous support of the architectural firm Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands and St Peter’s Residents’ Association with direct donations from SPRA members and estate agent Horton and Garton.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cdiv style='text-align: center;'\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cdiv style='text-align: center;'\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou can donate to the crowdfunding campaign at \u003Ca href='https://www.spacehive.com/thegreekrunner-stpeterssquare' style='color: red;'\u003Ehttps://www.spacehive.com/thegreekrunner-stpeterssquare\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/body\u003E\u003C/html\u003E",

        "detail_description_body": "New data from the London Fire Brigade has revealed that firefighters rescued 3,627 people since January 2024 – an average of more than six people a day.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFirefighters rescued 318 people from fires over the past 18 months – an average of four people a week. The fire with the most rescues occurred in Upper Norwood, where crews rescued 10 people from a flat fire.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHowever, firefighters are skilled and trained to respond to a variety of incidents, and since 2024 they have carried out rescues from 43 different types of emergencies across London.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFirefighters rescued 1,754 people who had collapsed behind a locked door, 463 people from lifts, 389 people from special service incidents, 229 people who were locked in, 73 people from road traffic collisions, 68 people from water and mud incidents, 58 people from chemical incidents, and 275 people from other incident categories.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EGroup Commander Shaun Coltress said: “When people think about rescues, they often imagine a firefighter carrying someone out of a burning building. But, as London’s rescue service, we are trained to carry out rescues in a variety of different ways.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E“Our fire engines carry dozens of pieces of equipment, and firefighters are trained to adapt their skills to unique scenarios.”\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe most common rescue was to someone collapsed behind a locked door, with three people a day, on average, needing help. Firefighters provide support to the London Ambulance Service (LAS) when someone is suspected to have collapsed behind a locked door and is need of medical attention. By using specialist techniques and equipment, the Brigade can help LAS crews gain entry to the property, enable them to treat the patient quickly, and with minimal damage to the property.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn addition, around five people are rescued every week by firefighters from other special service incidents, where no fire is involved and firefighters deploy the Brigade’s specialist equipment as part of their response. People frequently find themselves in tricky situations and need a helping hand. For example, in 2024 firefighters attended a person trapped in a cat flap, window cleaners trapped in their cradle at height, and a child with their head stuck in playground equipment. Additionally, in April 2024 firefighters rescued a man rescued a man trapped in a trench at a construction site in Charlton.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFirefighters also rescue almost one person or animal every week from a water related incident. Working with the Brigade’s specialist fireboat and Fire Rescue Unit crews, firefighters have carried out rescues when a vessel is in trouble or a swimmer is in danger. Notably, in March 2024 firefighters rescued two children from the River Colne in West Drayton.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EEvery other week, firefighters rescue someone from a chemical incident, where firefighters work alongside specialist hazardous material (HAZMAT) teams to respond to incidents like gas leaks and the unsafe mixing of common cleaning products. For example, in August 2024 firefighters carried out rescues at a swimming pool in Wembley following a chlorine leak.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDue to the high number of unique rescues attended by firefighters, the Brigade is urging the public to call 999 and not to be embarrassed in an emergency – the firefighters will almost certainly have attended a similar situation before.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EGroup Commander Coltress continued: “Sadly, our control officers sometimes receive calls where someone has been too embarrassed to call us and their situation has deteriorated for hours, or even days, before they have sought help.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E“Whatever the emergency, we will provide advice and assistance without judgment. Most of our rescues are completed in less than an hour, so it’s much better to ask for help than to wait and risk further harm to yourself or others.”\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOverall, the shortest rescues carried out by the Brigade take on average 20-30 minutes, such as non-emergency lift rescues and small animal rescues. The longest rescues take between two to three hours and include incidents like building collapses and flooding. The average duration of an incident involving a rescue is 43 minutes.",

There, under a blanket of stars and in the shadow of a warming fire he faces his past self who experienced the war back in Syria and the persona of the refugee he consequently became after his arrival. The dying embers of Hadi Al-Amaery are newly stoked by the raging fire in his heart.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThrough all the trauma and the grief that reignites his anger at the world and his place in it, he still wishes to heal; to overcome; to balance the scales of his existence, thus he compartmentalises his experiences and reconstructs himself – a clean burn.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe evening schedule is packed and will feature of a preview screening of ‘What if we were happy?’ by Julie-Yara Atz, along with a performance of short play ‘Hiroshima’ by Fellow Ruth O'Callaghan.

In June, the government invited proposals to be brought forward by the summer - with a deadline of 31st July.\u003Cbr /\u003E \u003Cbr /\u003EDetails of Heathrow’s proposals come after the Arora Group revealed its proposal, ‘Heathrow West’. Working with Bechtel, the Arora Group submitted a design that avoids the need to build over the M25, ‘allowing for faster delivery, reduced costs and improved environmental impact’.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003ETheir proposal comprises a ‘new modernised’ terminal, Terminal 6, located west of the existing Terminal 5, and a signature 2,800 metre runway ‘delivering for airlines, passengers and cargo’.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EKey beneﬁts are said to include reduced land take and lower disruption to local residents and businesses and the potential for an integrated and expanded Public Transport Hub.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EHeathrow’s proposals include: \u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA north-western runway up to 3,500m\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIncreased capacity to serve up to 756,000 flights and 150m passengers\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA brand-new terminal ‘T5X’, expanding Terminal 2 and three new satellite terminals.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003EHeathrow’s plans consist of three elements: £21bn for the new runway and airfield infrastructure (up from £14bn in 2018 due to construction inflation), £12bn for new terminal and stand capacity – the brand new T5X – and £15bn for modernising the current airport through expanding Terminal 2 and ultimately closing Terminal 3. \u003Cbr /\u003EHeathrow says expanding the airport would add 0.43% to the UK’s GDP, with 60% of the benefit felt outside of London and the South East as well as growing ‘the UK’s most valuable port’ by 50%.  \u003Cbr /\u003E \u003Cbr /\u003EAhead of the proposals being revealed, climate campaigners said ‘potential growth from a third runway at Heathrow is not certain, but worse air and noise pollution and threatened climate targets are’.\u003Cbr /\u003E \u003Cbr /\u003EThis comes after the prime minister incidicated that he is willing to do ‘whatever it takes’ to get  ‘spades in the ground’.\u003Cbr /\u003E \u003Cbr /\u003ETony Bosworth, Climate Campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said:  ‘‘If Keir Starmer wants to be seen as a climate leader, backing Heathrow expansion with ‘whatever it takes’ is the wrong move. A third runway raises serious, unanswered questions about how it fits in with the UK’s climate commitments.\u003Cbr /\u003E \u003Cbr /\u003E‘‘The scale of growth it would generate is uncertain, and meeting climate targets would rely heavily on expensive, unproven technologies. What is certain is that expanding Heathrow and other UK airports would drive up emissions, worsen air and noise pollution, and blight local communities. \u003Cbr /\u003E \u003Cbr /\u003E‘‘The UK’s green sector was the fastest-growing part of our economy last year. If the prime minister wants real, sustainable growth, he should champion investment in renewable energy, home insulation, public transport, green steel and clean energy storage - not more polluting runways. \u003Cbr /\u003E \u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E‘‘The government must commit to a fully transparent and democratic decision-making process, consulting all interested parties.

We are effectively operating at capacity to the detriment of trade and connectivity. With a green light from government and the correct policy support underpinned by a fit for purpose regulatory model, we are ready to mobilise and start investing this year in our supply chain across the country. We are uniquely placed to do this for the country; it is time to clear the way for take-off.”\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EA joint statement from the Confederation of British Industry, British Chambers of Commerce, MakeUK, Federation of Small Businesses and Institute of Directors, said:  “The UK business community supports the expansion of Heathrow with a third runway — an investment in the nation’s future. The benefits are clear: for exporters, it opens up vital access to major and emerging markets; for visitors, it enhances global and domestic connectivity; and for businesses, it unlocks billions in private investment, strengthening supply chains, creating jobs, and driving skills across the country.’’\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003C/body\u003E\u003C/html\u003E",

With such dominance, scrutiny becomes performative, and arrogance thrives. Labour in Hounslow operates on the assumption that they’ll always be in power—and for 15 years, they’ve been right. Why? It’s not because there’s no opposition, despite what some commenters suggest. It’s because the boring old left-wing rhetoric: Labour good, Conservatives bad.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003ELocal elections aren’t national elections. What matters is the quality of the people standing. And here in Hounslow, Labour’s dominance has created a machine that hides behind warm language and photo ops while wasting money, rewarding insiders, and resisting scrutiny. Their majority means they barely defend their decisions. Opposition voices are dismissed or shouted down. I should know—I’m often on the receiving end.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003ERecently on the ChiswickW4 forum, someone claimed the Conservative opposition has no bite. I disagree. There are only eight of us left—\u003Ca href='https://chiswickherald.co.uk/leader-reacts-as-tory-councillor-defects-to-labour-p26752-95.htm' style='color: red;'\u003Ethanks partly to the defection of Cllr Gill\u003C/a\u003E, now enjoying the safety of Labour’s numbers—but we remain active, vocal, and committed to holding this bloated system to account.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EWe don’t have a taxpayer-funded PR machine. Labour does. We don’t pay £50,000 in public money to five councillors for make-believe titles like “cabinet assistants.” Labour does.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003ELook at Hounslow Matters, the council’s weekly email and glossy magazine. You’d think only Labour councillors attend events or care about the community. In eight years, I can recall just two mentions of a Conservative councillor. It’s taxpayer-funded PR for Labour, plain and simple.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EA recent FOI revealed the council’s communications team now has 17 staff. \u003Ca href='https://chiswickherald.co.uk/councils-pr-spending-labelled-an-insult-to-residents-p26986-95.htm' style='color: red;'\u003EPR spending rose 13% in one year\u003C/a\u003E—from £1.97 million in 2024 to £2.22 million in 2025—while the council raised taxes to the legal max and raided emergency reserves. We’re told government funding is tight. But somehow, there’s still money for glossy self-promotion—and no mention of Lampton Group’s £13 million losses. Funny that.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThankfully, we have local media outlets like The Hounslow Herald, ChiswickW4, and Chiswick Calendar, who still report on local democracy. I don’t expect them to support us—but at least they let different voices be heard. That’s crucial. Truth matters.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EHere’s some truth Labour won’t promote: a senior Labour councillor, Raghwinder Siddhu, was recently suspended by the Solicitors Regulation Authority after a judge found he and his partner at SZ Solicitors had created documents retrospectively and gave unreliable evidence. He resigned from his law firm just before the ruling. He also \u003Ca href='https://chiswickherald.co.uk/cabinet-member-steps-down-after-law-firm-closed-p27020-95.htm' style='color: red;'\u003Estepped down from his cabinet post\u003C/a\u003E—but don’t worry, the family finances were protected. His wife, Cllr Emma Siddhu, was swiftly promoted by Council Leader Rajawat to Chair of Planning—one of the most powerful roles in local government. Her qualifications? Irrelevant, it seems. Just trust the leader.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EAnd it’s not an isolated case. Cllr Pritam Grewal has been promoted back into cabinet, while his wife, Cllr Ajmer Grewal, remains there too. Together, their household now earns nearly £69,000 in council allowances. And yet, Labour still trades on the myth of being the party of fairness.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThey raise your taxes, cut services, increase their own allowances, and rely on a PR machine to keep you distracted. Often, it works. But that doesn’t mean we should stay silent.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThis is why your vote at local elections matters. When one party has unchecked power, it stops listening. The public becomes an afterthought. Labour relies on you not noticing—or caring. Like the proverbial frog in hot water, by the time you realise what’s happening, it might be too late.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EChange will come only when we stop voting by habit and start paying attention to how councillors actually behave. Judge us by our actions, not our party labels. That will tell you the real story.\u003C/body\u003E\u003C/html\u003E",

In June, the government invited proposals to be brought forward by the summer - with a deadline of 31st July. This is the ﬁrst time the government has invited a competing proposal for Heathrow expansion.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe Arora Group says Bechtel has enabled a design that avoids the need to build over the M25, ‘allowing for faster delivery, reduced costs and improved environmental impact’.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe proposal comprises a ‘new modernised’ terminal, Terminal 6, located west of the existing Terminal 5, and a signature 2,800 metre runway ‘delivering for airlines, passengers and cargo’.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EKey beneﬁts are said to include reduced land take and lower disruption to local residents and businesses and the potential for an integrated and expanded Public Transport Hub.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe Arora Group says that with its ‘shorter runway, efficient construction programme, fewer dependencies and a clear path to site mobilisation’, the evidence provided in their submission ‘strongly suggests that this scheme, and the new runway in particular, can be delivered in the target timeframe established by the government - if not sooner’.\u003Cbr /\u003E \u003Cbr /\u003ESurinder Arora, Founder and Chairman of the Arora Group, said: “After a decade working with our world leading design and delivery team, I am very proud that the Arora Group can ﬁnally unveil to the UK Government our Heathrow West proposal, which directly meets and supports the United Kingdom’s primary objective of unlocking economic growth at the UK’s only hub airport, with a strong commitment of doing so on- budget and on-time.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E“I am so proud to stand alongside Bechtel, and their record of delivering almost 200 airport projects, on these detailed plans. The Heathrow West proposal delivers squarely on the secretary of state’s and chancellor’s ambition to obtain planning permission by the end of this Parliament, with a fully operational runway by 2035.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E“The Arora Group has a proven track record of delivering on time and on budget projects including in and around Heathrow Airport. We are delighted that the government has taken a common sense approach to invite proposals from all interested parties for the very ﬁrst time rather than granting exclusivity to the current airport operator, no matter its track record.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E“I want the UK to succeed. To do this, the UK Government’s Plan for Change needs to succeed and we want to play our part in order to make this happen. Our project will generate employment and skills training opportunities across every region of the UK.”\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Ca href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd6nvzjvwgqo' style='color: red;'\u003EAs reported by the BBC\u003C/a\u003E, Heathrow has declined to comment on the Arora Group’s proposal.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EEarlier this month Heathrow said it would be submitting its proposal to ministers by today’s deadline. A statement published by the airport said: “Our plans will be entirely privately financed and have the potential to kickstart economic growth across the whole of the UK from construction through to operation. Depending on the government’s response, we would aim to meet their ambition to secure planning permission in this Parliament and for the runway to be operational by 2035. New capacity would boost competition and choice for consumers, drive economic growth for the UK and improve operational resilience at the UK’s hub airport.’’\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EAnti-expansion campaigners from the No 3rd Runway Coalition say the airport is expected to submit more than one option for the expansion of the airport, including a ‘north west’ runway, as well as another proposal similar to the ‘original’ third runway which failed in 2010.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EA north west runway was proposed in 2019, which would have been at least 3,500 metres in length, according to the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS). This proposal has since been stalled.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003ESpeaking ahead of proposals being submitted to the government, Paul McGuinness, Chair of the No 3rd Runway Coalition, said: “The government estimates the cost of Heathrow’s expansion at an absurdly expensive £42bn, against the £2.2bn cost of Gatwick expansion, and rating agency Standard & Poor believes that already heavily indebted Heathrow will simply be unable to finance it without significant shareholder capital investment.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E“Notwithstanding the decade of construction disruption it would entail, the need to divert rivers and re-route major A-roads and demolish villages.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E“It will also have to rehouse 15,000 people even before any new infrastructure can be laid, there’s a real danger that we’ll end up with a hole in the ground and a debt pile for taxpayers to underwrite, because the government had foolishly encouraged Heathrow’s profligate self-interest, as if blind to the lessons of HS2.”\u003C/body\u003E\u003C/html\u003E",

These girders do most of the heavy lifting when supporting the tracks and trains above, acting as the backbone of each span.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe wheel timbers, blocks which run under the tracks on bridges, on the line heading away from London will be replaced with new, longer-lasting and eco-friendly ones. These will have a lifespan of 50 years, which helps reduce future maintenance.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EEngineers will also be refurbishing and strengthening the passenger footbridge at Chiswick station. This includes installation of new steel work, removal of the temporary scaffold support, water-jetting and re-painting. Network Rail say to ensure these works are completed efficiently, they will be closing the station footbridge from 2nd August to 15th September. A footpath diversion will be in place, requiring residents to use Grove Park Bridge to safely cross the railway.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMark Goodall, Wessex Route Director, said: “There is never a good time to close the railway and the decision was taken to carry out these works to encompass the August Bank Holiday and finish before the schools started again as fewer people travel during that week. We appreciate it is unfortunate to have a line closure clashing with Brentford’s first home game of the Premier League season. Our works are planned over 12 months in advance and we are working with both clubs to ensure that fans are well aware ahead of the game.”\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPeter Williams, Customer and Commercial Director at South Western Railway, said: “These upgrades will help keep the railway reliable and resilient for many years to come, and we’re grateful to our customers for their patience while they are carried out. With rail replacement buses in place, we recommend checking before you travel and allowing some extra time for your journey.”\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis work follows on from the renewals carried out last year between 28th July to 2nd August 2024. Last year, engineers renewed and strengthened the pins that join the steelwork together, allowing Network Rail to lift a speed restriction from the bridge. This meant that trains could run faster over the bridge, improving the reliability of journeys. They also renewed the wheel timbers beneath the track running towards London.",

Plant highlights include Achillea ‘Moonshine’, ‘Paprika’ and ‘Red Velvet’, and Hydrangea serrata ‘Bluebird’. This powerful visual statement welcomes visitors into the garden alongside an exposed coal seam showing fossilized plants, highlighting the connection between plants and fossil fuels.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EDelving into links between carbon emissions and climate change, a dry garden begins to showcase ways we can work together with plants to adapt to a changing climate. Here, drought-tolerant plants such as Parry's agave (Agave parryi) and lavendar dominate, illustrative of the plants we might look to for London gardens in 30 years.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cimg align='middle' class='pagephoto' src='https://westlondonherald.com/25-7-2025-3-35-49-pm-6183301.jpg'  alt='' /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E \u003Cbr /\u003E35 new trees have been selected for their resilience to projected future climate conditions. Trees play a critical role in helping urban areas adapt to climate change thanks to the myriad of ecosystem services they offer, including absorption of carbon dioxide, shade and shelter provision, and improvement of air quality by filtering out pollutants.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EA rain garden illustrates ways we can manage water flow, prevent soil erosion, reduce flooding, recharge moisture into the soil and support moisture-tolerant plants that maintain soil stability and carbon storage. Grasslands, wildflower meadows and native hedgerows will boost biodiversity and lock in carbon, as biodiverse habitats are more resilient and better at storing carbon than monocultures.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EAppearing to grow from the centre of the Carbon Garden as a symbolic fungal fruiting body is a pavilion designed by Mizzi Studio. Inspired by the symbiotic relationship between plants and fungi, the materials and structure have been modelled on biological processes, and the pavilion has been created using natural materials. A forward-tilted canopy directs rainwater into the rain garden, and the sheltered space will support school visits and community activities.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe Carbon Garden encourages visitors to become advocates for nature, highlighting actions we can all take in our everyday lives to support the health of plants and the planet.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003ERichard Wilford, Designer of the Carbon Garden and Manager of Garden Design at RBG Kew says: ‘‘The Carbon Garden offers a unique opportunity to showcase our ongoing research, combining scientific insight with thoughtful design and beautiful planting to highlight the role of carbon in our lives, how it moves through the environment and how plants and fungi can help us tackle climate change. We hope the Carbon Garden inspires visitors to act and join us in shaping a more sustainable, resilient future for life on our planet.’’\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe Carbon Garden has been made possible thanks to funding from Biffa Award through the Landfill Communities Fund, funds raised by players of People’s Postcode Lottery, and generous philanthropy and donations.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cimg align='middle' class='pagephoto' src='https://westlondonherald.com/25-7-2025-3-36-24-pm-3457837.jpg'  alt='' /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E \u003Cbr /\u003ERachel Maidment, Biffa Award Grants Manager, said: ‘‘We are immensely proud to support the Carbon Garden, which will educate and inspire visitors about the vital role of carbon in our environment. Through the Landfill Communities Fund, we are committed to funding projects that have a lasting positive impact on both people and the planet. We are particularly excited that this garden will not only showcase Kew’s research but will also serve as a hub for learning, demonstrating how collective action can drive real environmental change. Biffa Award is honoured to play a role in bringing this vision to life.’’\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003ELaura Chow, Head of Charities at People’s Postcode Lottery commented: ‘‘RBG Kew’s new Carbon Garden is a fantastic example of how support from players of People’s Postcode Lottery is driving positive change for the planet. It is because of them that this innovative project can be brought to life, inspiring people to come together to learn more about the world we live in and protect nature for generations to come.’’\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe Carbon Garden is a must-see attraction this summer at Kew Gardens which is celebrating everything that is wonderful about trees. Alongside The Power of Trees exhibition in the Shirley Sherwood Gallery of Botanical Art, and Of the Oak, an inspiring outdoor installation by Marshmallow Laser Feast which explores the secrets of Kew’s magnificent Lucombe Oak, there are a host of ways to enjoy the wonder of Kew’s collections.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EAll images: Ines Stuart-Davidson © RBG Kew\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/body\u003E\u003C/html\u003E",

Existing donors are also being asked to recruit family members, as they are 30% more likely to have the same group.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E‘‘The number of active B negative donors has reached one of the lowest points in recent years, following a loss of 1,000 donors since 2023,’’ said the service’s Gerry Gogarty. ‘‘It’s one of the rarest blood types, and it can be a challenge to collect enough.’’\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EHospitals across England need more than 5,000 blood donations every day; equating to three blood donations required every minute to deal with emergencies, childbirth and routine treatments. Blood only has a shelf life of 35 days, so supplies are constantly needed.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EAs well as B neg, there is continuing need for donors who are O negative and RO – with, statistically, donors of Black heritage more likely to be in the group. Donating takes an hour, with each donation capable of saving up to three lives. Men can give blood every three months, women every four.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe Shepherd’s Bush blood donor centre is one of the few in the country where younger donors outnumber older counterparts, with two in three donors aged between 17 and 44.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EJust 2 per cent of blood donors in London are B negative, compared to 36 per cent of donors in the most common O positive group.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EWestfield Mall’s blood centre has vacant slots, so if you can donate, register online at the \u003Ca href='https://www.blood.co.uk/' style='color: red;'\u003EGive Blood website\u003C/a\u003E or call 0300 123 23 23 to book a slot.

One witness filmed Mosquera acting suspiciously before Mosquera attempted to knock the phone out of his hand and ran away.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe police were alerted to his suspicious behaviour and a murder investigation was launched after officers discovered the body parts inside the cases.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EAn address label left on one of the cases led police back to Scotts Road, and on Wednesday 10th July, Met officers would find crucial evidence in a search of the property, including the decapitated heads of both men in a chest freezer in a hallway of the flat. The murder weapons were found close by.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EHomicide detectives built a case with an abundance of evidence to support the motive that Mosquera murdered both men to obtain their property and their money.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EDetectives would discover Mosquera had researched a freezer online on several occasions, including the one that he later ordered to be delivered to the address.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EMosquera, who was a Columbian national, had also conducted searches online in Spanish, on topics such as how long it would take for a body to decompose and where on the head would be a fatal blow.\u003Cbr /\u003E \u003Cbr /\u003ESubscribe to our weekly ePaper for £2 a month - click here\u003Cbr /\u003E \u003Cbr /\u003E \u003Cbr /\u003EExaminations of Mosquera’s laptop revealed that in the weeks before the murders he was browsing the internet in an effort to find out the value of the Shepherd’s Bush property, and he accessed information about Paul’s and Albert’s finances.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EHe had also attempted to open a bank account using the Scotts Road address. Immediately after the murders, he accessed a spreadsheet which contained their online banking passwords, and attempted to login to a number of their online bank accounts. He unsuccessfully attempted to send £4,000 to his account in Columbia.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EMosquera had got to know both men, who were in a civil partnership, over a number of years, and had been staying with them at their flat for the month prior to their murders. It was a property where the two men had lived happily for many years together.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EMosquera was involved in a consensual sexual relationship with Albert, one which Paul was aware of and lovingly accepted. The court heard Albert simply had no reason to kill his partner, Paul, despite Mosquera’s defence that the two of them were in a controlling and coercive relationship.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EIt was while Albert was at work that Mosquera killed Paul. A neighbour recalls speaking to Paul that morning from one of the windows. This was the last sighting of him alive. Detectives trawled hours of footage from a CCTV camera, located opposite the entrance to the Scotts Road flat, which captured Mosquera standing at the window of the flat and drawing the curtains at around 12:30. It was then that he is believed to have killed Paul.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe post-mortem revealed Paul had died from multiple severe blunt force traumas to the head with a hammer, with injuries on his hands suggesting he’d try to defend himself. Mosquera hid the body in a divan storage space under the bed in Paul’s room and waited for Albert to come home.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EAlbert arrived home early evening. The killing was captured on cameras which had been set up in Albert's bedroom to record a sex session between him and Mosquera. The footage showed Mosquera performing sex acts on Albert in his bedroom, before repeatedly stabbing him and cutting his throat.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EMosquera was arrested in Bristol in the early hours of Saturday 13th July 2024. He was charged with two counts of murder two days later.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EAlthough he had admitted killing Albert, he denied the offence of murder, admitting only the lesser offence of manslaughter following what he called, a loss of self-control. He also denied murdering Paul, claiming his long-term partner, Albert, had killed him instead.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EMosquera will be sentenced at the same court in October.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EDetective Inspector Neil Meade, of Avon and Somerset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team, said: “These crimes were truly horrific and our thoughts are with the families and friends of Albert and Paul.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E“Yostin Mosquera’s actions have had a significant impact on our communities in Avon and Somerset and I'm very grateful for the support we received at the time of the incident and have received since.

An officer will then review the match and decide if they wish to speak with the individual.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EOfficers conduct further checks, such as reviewing court orders or other relevant information, to determine if the person is a suspect.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EAn alert from the system does not automatically result in an arrest - officers make a decision about whether further action is necessary following engagement.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe Met says there are robust safeguards in place regarding LFR, if a member of the public walks past an LFR camera and is not wanted by the police, their biometrics are immediately and permanently deleted.\u003Cbr /\u003E \u003Cbr /\u003EThe force will also be deploying screening arches at some of the busiest entry points, using stop and search powers to prevent knives and other deadly weapons being carried at Carnival. \u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EDeputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward, the police commander for this year’s event, said: “Notting Hill Carnival is an iconic event in London’s cultural calendar which is celebrated by many from across the capital, the UK and beyond. With less than six weeks to go before this year's event, the Met continues to work closely with organisers and partners to ensure it's a safe and spectacular experience for those visiting.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E“Regrettably, amongst the millions of carnivalists who have attended over many years there has been a tiny minority of individuals intent on causing serious harm to others, including violent crime and sexual offences.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E“Their actions stand in stark contrast to the traditions and values of Carnival and I welcome those voices in the community who have stood up to condemn violence and serious criminality at the event. I fully support the organisers’ recent announcement of a new, innovative partnership with the Elba Hope Foundation to divert young people away from crime and particularly knife crime.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E“Carnival’s growing popularity and size creates unique challenges. Around 7,000 officers and staff will be deployed each day over the coming August Bank Holiday weekend. Their priority is to keep people safe, including preventing serious violence, such as knife crime and violence against women and girls.”\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe Met says its activity has already started with a focus on deterring or preventing those who pose the greatest threat to public safety. This includes:\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESharing intelligence with forces across the country to identify those violent gangs who are planning to attend Carnival\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWorking with others, including local authorities and the courts, to seek banning orders to exclude those attending who have a history of violence or sexual offending at Carnival\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECarrying out pre-emptive intelligence-led arrests and searches of those believed to be in possession of weapons or involved in the supply of drugs. Last year there were 160 such arrests prior to the event for offences including possession of firearms, drugs supply, rape and other serious sexual assaults.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003EPolice are also appealing for anyone with information about groups or individuals intending to engage in violence at this year’s Notting Hill Carnival to come forward.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EOfficers are working with the independent charity Crimestoppers as part of their plan to keep Carnival free from knife crime, serious violence and violence against women and girls.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003ECrimestoppers is an independent charity, not part of the police and 100 per cent anonymous. Their commitment to protect people’s identity is iron-clad – they won’t ask for a name and can’t identify any telephone numbers or IP addresses if you are reporting online.

In doing so, you could be saving a life.”\u003C/body\u003E\u003C/html\u003E",
